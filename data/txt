BEGIN and END are two special kinds of patterns
which are not tested against the input.
The action parts of all BEGIN patterns are merged
as if all the statements had been written
in a single BEGIN rule.
They are executed before any of the input is read.
Similarly, all the END rules are merged,
and executed when all the input is exhausted 
(or when an exit statement is executed).
BEGIN and END patterns cannot be combined with
other patterns in pattern expressions.
BEGIN and END patterns cannot have missing action parts.

BEGINFILE and ENDFILE are additional special patterns
whose actions are executed before
reading the first record of each command-line input file
and after reading the last record of each file.
Inside the BEGINFILE rule,
the value of ERRNO is the empty string if the file was opened successfully.
Otherwise, there is some problem with the file and
the code should use nextfile to skip it.
If that is not done, gawk produces its usual fatal error
for files that cannot be opened.
